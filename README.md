# Tiny
TinyML innovation toolkit

## Case studies
1. Sea grass (Jamie has trained model this could be used to start quantisation aware training, pruning and deploying) - Ollie?
2. Water quality (Lorenza has trained model this could be used to start quantisation aware training, pruning and deploying)
3. New data - Sentinel-2 satellite-derived bathymetry to map the coast of Dominica, before and after Hurricane Maria (27 September 2017): Will need downloading and cleaning - Rhea?
4. Space weather dataset: This needs to be identified and then downloaded and cleaning. - Thierry?
5. Codes specific to deploying on TinyML device and research into what devices are best and why (Arduino nano, sony sprescence, edge GPU and TPUs, FPGAs?). - Will?
6. Digital twins of the arduino
